Introduction (5 minutes)

Warm-up: Briefly review familiar looping concepts like for loops and basic data structures in Python.
Motivation: Introduce the idea of hidden iterators as the workhorses behind looping, emphasizing their efficiency and memory conservation.
Learning Objectives: Clearly state what participants will learn:
Understanding iterables and iterators
Using built-in iterator methods (next(), iter())
Creating custom iterators with generator expressions
Applying iterators for powerful, memory-efficient code
Understanding Iterables and Iterators (10 minutes)

Iterables:
Explain that iterables are objects (lists, strings, dictionaries) that can be "looped over" using for loops.
Use clear examples to showcase how in and for loops work internally with iterators.
Iterators:
Define iterators as special objects that hold a value and a position, acting like state machines.
Highlight the __iter__() and __next__() methods as the backbone of iterators.
Demonstrate how iterators provide one value at a time, not the entire collection.
Built-in Iterator Methods (5 minutes)

next(iterator):
Show how next() moves the iterator forward and returns the current value (with error handling for StopIteration).
Illustrate with practical examples like iterating over strings character by character.
iter(object):
Explain how iter() creates an iterator from an iterable, even if it already has one.
Emphasize the use of iter() to loop over non-iterable objects like custom classes.
Creating Custom Iterators with Generator Expressions (15 minutes)

Motivation: Introduce generator expressions as a concise and memory-efficient way to create iterators.
Syntax:
Show the format: (value for value in expression), highlighting its similarities to list comprehensions.
Use live coding demonstrations to create iterators that:
Generate squares of numbers
Filter even numbers from a list
Perform custom logic on each element
Benefits:
Reiterate the memory efficiency and laziness (computing values on demand) advantages of generator expressions.
Briefly mention generators (functions that return generator expressions) if appropriate for the audience level.
Applying Iterators for Powerful, Memory-Efficient Code (10 minutes)

Real-world use cases:
Showcase how iterators are used in:
Reading large files one line at a time (avoiding loading the entire file into memory)
Processing infinite data streams
Creating custom iterables for complex data structures
Implementing custom control flow using iterators
Efficiency:
Quantify the memory savings from using iterators compared to lists or other data structures.
Provide tips on when to use iterators for optimal performance.
